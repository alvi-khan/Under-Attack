<h2 data-children-count="0">Gameplay:</h2>
<p data-children-count="0">Place turrets on the playing field by dragging them in from the inventory on the right.</p>
<p data-children-count="0">Turrets can only shoot a short distance (they aren't the best turrets), so be careful about where you place them!</p>
<p data-children-count="0">Keep an eye on your gold. It depletes fast if you aren't careful.</p>
<p data-children-count="0">You lose points if you take damage. You gain points if your enemy takes damage. You also get some gold if you destroy a turret or the enemy base camp.</p>
<p data-children-count="0">Use the repair tool to repair damaged turrets and the shield tool to give a turret some extra defense.</p>
